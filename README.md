# AMC Progress Tracker

A Python coach that helps you prepare for the **AMC math competition** (held 4th–6th of August). Instead of just logging a score, you log **which questions you got right** — and the program finds your **wall**, the exact point where your paper starts leaking points, then tells you precisely what to drill next for the biggest gain.

## ⭐ The headline feature: Section Breakdown + Pacing Coach

The AMC's 30 questions split into difficulty **sections** — Easy (Q1–10), Mid (Q11–20), Hard (Q21–25), Very Hard (Q26–30). Your fastest score gains don't come from the hard problems you can't do; they come from the **section you're closest to locking in.**

So the tracker:

- 📊 **Scores you by section** — Easy / Mid / Hard accuracy at a glance.
- 🎯 **Names the section to focus on next** — the easiest one you haven't locked in (the cheapest points to recover).
- ⏱️ **Diagnoses pacing vs accuracy** — it separates questions you left **blank** (a speed problem) from ones you **got wrong** (a knowledge problem), so you know whether to train for time or for technique.
- 🟢🟡🔴 **Charts accuracy per section** — green = locked in, yellow = shaky, red = needs work.

```
----- SECTION BREAKDOWN -----
Easy  (Q1-10):   100%  (locked in)
Mid   (Q11-20):    30%  (needs work)
Hard  (Q21-25):    10%  (needs work)
Very Hard (Q26-30):  0%  (needs work)
Focus section:      Mid (Q11-20)  (your biggest available gain)
Pacing check:       you leave ~10 questions BLANK per test - work on speed.
```

## Two coach modes

When you log a session you pick how much detail to give:

| Mode | You enter | You unlock |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Detailed** ⭐ *(recommended)* | *Which* questions you got right (e.g. `1,2,3,7`) | Everything below **+ the section breakdown** that tells you exactly what to study |
| **Quick** | *How many* you got right (e.g. `11`) | Score trend, projection, target pace, difficulty level, and pacing check |

**Detailed is the better coach** — it's the only mode that can see *where* your points are leaking, so it can name the section to focus on. Quick mode is just for when you're in a hurry; the program will gently nudge you toward Detailed.

## What else it does

- 📅 **Counts down** the days until the next AMC competition.
- ✍️ **Records each session** — enter how many you answered and which you got right; it flags how many you got wrong and **reminds you to review them.** Saved as JSON with the date.
- 📈 **Calculates your growth rate** — percentage points improved per week (line of best fit through your history).
- 🔮 **Projects your competition-day score** based on your current trend.
- 🎯 **Tracks a target score** — tells you the weekly pace you need, and whether you're **ON TRACK** or **BEHIND**.
- 🧠 **Recommends a difficulty level** (Foundations → Intermediate → Advanced → Olympiad) with coaching advice.
- 📊 **Plots two graphs** — your score trend (with projection + competition date) and your accuracy by section.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (for the graph)

Install matplotlib if you don't have it:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to use it

1. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python3 AMC_Progress_Tracker.py
   ```

2. It shows today's date and the days left until the competition.
3. Pick your **coach mode**: `1` Detailed (recommended) or `2` Quick.
4. Enter **how many questions you answered** (attempted) this session.
5. Then either the question numbers you got right (Detailed, e.g. `1,2,3,7,11`) or just how many (Quick). It works out how many you got wrong and **reminds you to go back and check them.**
6. Read your analysis (growth rate, projection, target status, recommended level, **section breakdown and pacing check**) and view the two graphs.
7. Choose `y` to log another session, or `n` to quit.

Your scores are saved between runs, so the more you log, the more accurate your trend and projection become.

### Setting your target

Open `AMC_Progress_Tracker.py` and change this line near the top to whatever score you're aiming for:

```python
TARGET_SCORE = 100.0  # the score you're aiming to reach by competition day
```

## The files

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `AMC_Progress_Tracker.py` | The main program. Contains all the logic: the countdown, score entry, growth-rate calculation, projection, target tracking, difficulty recommendation, and the graph. |
| `AMC_Progress_Tracker_Test.py` | The automated test suite (pytest). Tests every function so you can be confident the maths and file handling work correctly. |
| `amc_scores.json` | Auto-created when you log your first session. Stores your history as a JSON list of records, e.g. `{"date": "2026-05-30", "score": 60.0, "answered": 20, "correct": [1, 2, 3, 7]}`. Not committed to git — it's your personal data. |
| `.gitignore` | Tells git to ignore auto-generated Python folders (`__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`) and your local score data. |
| `README.md` | This file. |

## Running the tests

The project comes with a full pytest suite. Run it with:

```bash
python3 -m pytest AMC_Progress_Tracker_Test.py -v
```

All tests should pass. They cover the date countdown, score input and validation, growth-rate maths, score projection (including the 0–100% cap), target-pace calculations, difficulty recommendations, and the graph — using fake input and a non-popup graph backend so nothing interrupts the run.
